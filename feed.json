            "content_html": "<p>In 2010 the US Census Bureau did something different, they got rid of the long form.  In previous censuses some people got the short form, others got the long form.  The long form asked a ton of questions. Questions about you income, languages spoken at home, educational attainments, etc. Every ten years the census release a very detailed profile of the american population (often known as summary file 3). A profile that various government agencies used to appropriate funds and the like. And a profile the researchers used to study social and demographic trends.</p>\n<p>Having all this data about the american population the census bureau was able to perfect the art of estimating this data from smaller samples. So in 2010 they did away with the long form and the resulting summary file 3.  It was replaced with the American Community Survey (ACS).</p>\n<p>The ACS is a rolling survey and is updated annually.  The census bureau is able to send the survey to a much smaller number of household and still produce statistically reliable profiles. The ACS data come in three flavors: 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates.  A good summery of the different levels is available <a  href=\"http://www.census.gov/acs/www/guidance_for_data_users/estimates/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>For those of you who may not know, census data is aggregated to a number of different geographies. Starting with individual forms (households) they are aggregated into Blocks --(into)--&gt; Block Groups --&gt; Census Tracts --&gt; Counties --&gt; States --&gt; US Totals. This is the most common hierarchy but there are a number of others that serve special purposes.</p>\n<div >\n<p>The individual forms can only be viewed under direct supervision at secure facilities by qualified researchers.  At the block level only population counts are offered and are not part of the ACS.  So block groups are highest resolution data available to the general public and for privacy reason we can only get 5-year estimates at the block group level.</p>\n</div>\n<div > </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div > </div>",
